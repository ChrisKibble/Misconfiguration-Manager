# Misconfiguration Manager
This repository serves as a central knowledge-base for all known Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (AKA MECEM, ConfigMgr,  Systems Center Configuration Manager or SCCM) tradecraft and associated defensive and hardening guidance.

Rather than writing a long, dull whitepaper, we opted to create a living, community-driven knowledge-base aimed at both offensive and defensive security professionals, as well as systems administrators.

At SpecterOps, we've abused many of the misconfigurations highlighted in this repository in real-world environments while a few are more experimental research projects proved out in a lab.

As the community continues to research SCCM's attack surface, we must also rely on contributions from the community to keep this repository up-to-date and as helpful as possible. Please submit a PR if you've identified a gap that we've missed!
